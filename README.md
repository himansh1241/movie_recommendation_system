# movie_recommendation_system
This project is a simple and smart content-based movie recommendation system built using Python, scikit-learn, and Streamlit. It analyses movie metadata like genres, keywords, cast, and crew, turns them into meaningful tags using TF-IDF, and then recommends the top 10 similar movies using cosine similarity.
